# Deepfake-Video-Detection-using-deep-learning
Deep learning has shown to be a successful approach for solving several difficult problems, such as huge data analytics, computer vision, and human-level control. However, developments in deep learning have also been used to produce software that compromises democracy, privacy, and national security. Deepfake is the name of one of the recent deep learning applications. Deepfake algorithms have the ability to produce convincingly fake images and videos that are hard for people to tell apart from the real thing. Deepfake is a subfield of artificial intelligence that creates convincing image, audio, and video frauds by combining the generator and discriminator algorithms, two rival AI techniques that comprise a generative adversarial network (GAN). A Reddit user going by the username Deepfakes discussed the origins of the term "Deepfake" in 2017. Although there are numerous techniques for identifying Deepfakes, not all of them are flawless and consistent in every situation. Furthermore, outdated generalizing methods must be updated frequently to keep up with the most recent methods for producing deep fakes. My research focuses on cutting-edge techniques that integrate many Deep Learning models to create changed videos and identify them. We test our method on a large-scale balanced and mixed data-set created by combining the different accessible data-sets, such as Face-Forensic++, Deepfake detection challenge, and Celeb-DF, YouTube Videos, and custom crafted deepfakes, in order to replicate real-time scenarios and improve the model's performance on real-time data. We also demonstrate how our method can produce competitive outcomes in a very straightforward and reliable way. Our model was trained on 400 films in all, 217 train and 183 test videos. We achieved 94.871794% accuracy on the total.
 we can spot them by focusing on small aspects, such as dull shadows around the eyes, unrealistic facial hair, overly smooth or wrinkled skin, fictitious moles and unnatural lip colour.
